<h2>About</h2>

Hey there! I’m Marios a Senior Software Engineer with a decade of experience crafting web
applications—mostly powered by Java and Spring Boot. I’m all about building efficient,
user-focused solutions that stand the test of time (and the scrutiny of late-night debugging sessions).

When I’m off the clock, you’ll probably find me jamming on the piano or guitar,
experimenting with new melodies, or trying out a tasty recipe in the kitchen.
Music and cooking give me a creative spark, that I love bringing back into my work.

Want to geek out about code, chat about music, or swap favorite recipes? Feel
free to reach. I’m always up for good conversation and fresh ideas!
